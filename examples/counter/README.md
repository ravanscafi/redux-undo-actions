# Counter Example

Based on the
[Counter example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/counter-ts)
from Redux, but using vite instead of CRA.
And with the extra logic for
using [@ravanscafi/redux-undo-actions](https://github.com/ravanscafi/redux-undo-actions).

## Running the example
```shell
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests
```shell
npm test
```
